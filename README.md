Indian Sports Archive – Brutalist Edition
An experimental, interactive web archive showcasing 50 Indian sports through a bold brutalist UI. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, GSAP, and vanilla JavaScript, the project features smooth animations, 3D interactions, theme toggling, and a modal-based exploration experience highlighting the history, players, and legacy of Indian athletics.

If you want a short one-line description for the GitHub header instead, use:
